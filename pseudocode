Define the constants:
mass of cow: 1000 kg
gravitational acceleration: 9.8 m/s/s
  
Set the initial conditions:
start time: 0 sec
create a set of initial position and velocity values

Create a function that returns the total force vector:
The total force will be the sum of drag force and gravity
Force of gravity = -mg
Drag force = C*v^2 (negative?)
Then return the total force
There is an x and y component of drag force:
Drag force = - C*|v^2| = -C|v|^2 * (v/|v|) = C * |v| * v
Then return the total force
